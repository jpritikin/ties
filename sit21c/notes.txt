Discussion questions

Are we really measuring mental silence?

How to distinguish mental silence and daydreaming?

One participant said that mental silence was important for
daydreaming; He defined prayer as the combination of daydreaming and
mental silence.

Any other proximate contrasts similar but different from mental silence?

Who is causing mental silence? In Indian philosophy, individual
identity is a composite of two concepts atma and paramatma. Points to
problem with questions like ``Can you cause yourself to experience MS''

Related point: What is meant by accidental? Some teachers say that
mental silence can only be caused by the individuals own desire.

Contrasts are important for validity. Looking for a context for each
of mental silence and boredom where the target experience is
difficult. Hard to find for mental silence.
